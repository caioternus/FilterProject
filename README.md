- This project shows a responsive web page for product catalog (watches);
  
- The user can filter product options by name, category and price range;

- The user can search for the watch of interest by typing the name into the search box in the upper left corner, and the page will then display only the watch options that match the description;

- The user can also filter the watches by category (e.g. luxury or sports), as well as by the maximum price bar in the left corner. The page then displays the updated watch catalog to the user, containing a photo, name and price for each model that matches the filter;

- Currently, the website catalog contains only six registered watches whose prices range from $16 to $200;

- Watches listed by price (description, price and category): Casio Classic Resin Strap ($16, Sport); Timex Men's Expedition Scout ($40, Sport); Garmin Venu Smartwatch ($74, Casual); Invicta Men's Pro Driver ($74, Dress); Invicta Men's Pro Driver 2 ($74, Dress); Breitling Superocean Heritage ($200, Luxury);

- This project was developed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
